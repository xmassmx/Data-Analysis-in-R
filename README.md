# GE-461-Data-Analysis-in-R
Hi, 

This repository contains my work for the first project of the GE-461: Introduction to Data Science course. 

The project involves data analysis in R for a Dodgers dataset where the aim is to create a report for the management that allows them to maximise the attendance and profit. 
My report can be accessed here: https://xmassmx.github.io/GE-461-Data-Analysis-in-R/
